# Athena
## Inspiration
Our inspiration for the idea for Athena was Devin AI, the recent hype about Devin and how its gonna take away all the jobs led to Athena.
## What it does
It is basically an AI software engineer which can convert high level instructions to code!
## How we built it
We built it using the arctic snowflake model, streamlit, langchain etc combining different ai agents like scrapper, coder, researcher, Planner etc.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges related to the collective working of the agents which would involve perfect sync between all agents and some general model hallucinations here and there!
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of successfully creating this project in just 18 hrs! with team of just 3 amateurs.
## What we learned
We learned about the working of ai agents and different pre-prompt methods to change the model's behaviour!
## What's next for Athena
Our next plan is to refactor the frontend and add RAG and memory to it.
